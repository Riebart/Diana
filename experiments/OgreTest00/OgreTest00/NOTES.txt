There is a custom macro OGRE_HOME set to the root directory of the Ogre SDK >= 1.9.0.

To change this based on your environment: 
    View->Property Manager (May need to expand "Other Windows")->double-click User Macros

You'll also, if you're building on VS2013, probably need to isntall Boost for MSVC12 into the OgreSDK Boost library folder
You'll also need to add the programs/GLSL folder to the resourced[_d].cfg in bin/* in the OgreSDK tree.
